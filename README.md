This project involves building a neural network to classify images of cats and dogs accurately. Using a dataset of labeled images, the model is trained with convolutional layers to extract key features. Techniques like image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation are applied to improve model performance. Frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch are used for model design, training, and evaluation, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between cats and dogs.
